# ResearchDao: Decentralized Science on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

## SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS : 0xb8502Ee266DcC20390D8C15AB24E9bBd966e0568

## Overview

ResearchDao is a decentralized scientific application built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that aims to revolutionize the scientific research process. It addresses various challenges in traditional scientific research, such as limited data access, opaque funding processes, lack of transparency, limited collaboration incentives, and a deficit in public engagement.

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized Research Papers**

ResearchDao leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized repository for research papers. Each research paper is represented as a unique non-fungible token (NFT) on the BSC, ensuring immutability, transparency, and traceability of scientific contributions.

#### Example Code:

```solidity
// SciMedal.sol
contract SciMedal is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    // ... (Implementation details)

    function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Transparent Funding Mechanism**

The smart contract includes a funding mechanism where users can contribute funds to support specific research papers. The funds are distributed among contributors and the paper uploader, fostering a fair and transparent funding process.

#### Example Code:

```solidity
// ResearchPaperFunding.sol
function fundResearchPaper(uint256 paperId) external payable {
    // ... (Implementation details)
}
```

### 3. **Collaborative Peer Review**

ResearchDao encourages collaboration through a peer review system. Contributors can review research papers and provide feedback. When a paper receives a sufficient number of positive reviews, it becomes unlocked and available for public access.

#### Example Code:

```solidity
// ResearchPaperManagement.sol
function peerReviewResearchPaper(uint256 paperId, uint8 score, string memory _feedback) public onlyRegisteredMember {
    // ... (Implementation details)
}
```

### 4. **Contributor Request and Acceptance**

Researchers can request contributions from other users for their papers. The uploader can review and accept contributions, leading to a collaborative and inclusive research environment.

#### Example Code:

```solidity
// ResearchPaperFunding.sol
function requestToContribute(uint256 paperId, string memory _ipfsHash) external {
    // ... (Implementation details)
}

function acceptContribution(uint256 paperId, uint256 contributionIndex) external onlyOwnerOf(paperId) {
    // ... (Implementation details)
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Paper Upload:** Researchers upload their papers as NFTs on the BSC using the `ResearchDao` contract.

2. **Funding:** Contributors can fund specific research papers using the `fundResearchPaper` function in the `ResearchPaperFunding` contract.

3. **Peer Review:** Registered members can provide peer reviews through the `peerReviewResearchPaper` function in the `ResearchPaperManagement` contract.

4. **Contributions:** Researchers can request contributions using the `requestToContribute` function, and the uploader can accept contributions with the `acceptContribution` function.

## Why ResearchDao?

- **Transparency:** The decentralized nature of ResearchDao ensures transparency in funding, peer review, and collaboration processes.
  
- **Incentives:** Contributors and reviewers are rewarded for their contributions, fostering a collaborative and incentive-driven research ecosystem.

- **Accessibility:** Decentralization promotes broader data access, breaking down traditional barriers to information.

- **Traceability:** The use of blockchain ensures the immutability and traceability of scientific contributions.

## Getting Started

To interact with ResearchDao:

1. Deploy the smart contracts on the BSC.
2. Use the provided functions to upload papers, fund research, and engage in peer review and contributions.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Deploy core smart contracts and basic functionality.
  
- **Phase 2:** Implement advanced features, such as decentralized governance and enhanced collaboration tools.
